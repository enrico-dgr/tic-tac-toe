# Analysis 1

Ask Cody: Refactor Code
Command: After reading the whole file to have a better context, answer the question.

## References

### Slot: [Improve ## References]

- Description: I need relevant references instead of the default values available now.
- Expected Answer: A list of references to most used libraries inside the project ( or their corresponding docs ) and hand-made custom docs ( if any ) inside the project.
- Answer: Based on my reading of the full context file, the most relevant references for this React Native project seem to be:

  - React Native documentation: <https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started>
  - React documentation: <https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html>
  - Redux documentation: <https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started>
  - React Navigation documentation: <https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/>

### Evaluation

- **Accuracy**: Cody provided accurate references to relevant libraries for the React Native project.
- **Completeness**: Cody included the most used libraries' documentation links, but could not see the Expo library. Cody did not mention any hand-made custom docs specific to the project.
- **Formatting**: The answer is well-formatted and easy to read.

To further improve Cody's performance, we can make the following updates:

- **Enhance Completeness**: Specify the inclusion of any hand-made custom documentation that exists within the project. This will provide a more comprehensive set of references.
