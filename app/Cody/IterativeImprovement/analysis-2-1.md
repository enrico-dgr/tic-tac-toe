Ask Cody: Refactor Code
Command: After reading the whole file to have a better context, answer the question.

### Slot: [Write a template]

- Description: Write a script's template for a hook, so I can copy-paste before writing a new hook or for your context before creating a new hook based on my instructions. Output: file template.ts inside hooks' directory.
- Expected Answer: A typescript template inside a json-input.
- Answer: After reading the whole file to have a better context, here is a template for a custom hook in TypeScript:

```ts
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function useCustomHook(initialState: Type) {
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Effect logic
  }, [/* dependencies */]);

  // Helper functions

  return {
    state,
    setState
  };
}
```

This follows the convention of hooks returning a stateful value and a function to update it. The hook can manage its own state and effects internally. Please let me know if you would like me to modify the template in any way.

### Evaluation

- **Accuracy**: 60%. The script in TS template is pretty good, but doesn't look to other example I made under hooks directory.
- **Completeness**: Does not match the input-json format.
- **Formatting**: When asking for `Output: file <name> inside..` the code-content inside fences must be served like this

JSON-INPUTS-START

[{

  "path": "../asd.js",

  "content": "

  ```ts
  import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

  export default function useCustomHook(initialState: Type) {
    const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);

    useEffect(() => {
      // Effect logic
    }, [/* dependencies */]);

    // Helper functions

    return {
      state,
      setState
    };
  }
  ```

  "

}]

JSON-INPUTS-END

so that can be interpreted as content to write inside another file.

To further improve Cody's performance, we can make the following updates:

- **Enhance Accuracy**: Look in name-related files
- **Enhance Completeness**:
- **Enhance Formatting**:
