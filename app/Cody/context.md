# Cody Context File

The context file serves as a guide for Cody, helping it understand the purpose, structure, and requirements of your project. It provides relevant information about coding approaches, answer slots, project-specific details, and iterative improvement. Here's a summary of what each section of the file is used for:

1. Coding Approaches: This section provides an overview of different coding approaches relevant to your project. It includes descriptions, best practices, and code examples for each approach. Cody can refer to this section to understand the preferred coding style and techniques to be used.

2. Answer Slots: Answer slots define specific areas where you expect Cody to provide answers or information. Each answer slot has a title, description, and an indication of the expected answer format. You can customize the answer slots based on the specific questions or areas of interest you have for Cody.

3. References: This section lists relevant resources, such as links to documentation, articles, or tutorials that Cody can refer to for additional information. Providing references helps Cody access reliable information and enhance the quality of its responses.

4. Project-Specific Information: This section allows you to provide project-specific details. You can include information about subdirectories in your project, their purposes, and relevant files. This helps Cody understand the structure and context of your project, enabling it to provide more accurate and context-aware responses.

5. Iterative Improvement: This section emphasizes that the context file is a living document that will be updated and improved based on interactions with Cody. It encourages users to provide feedback on Cody's answers to help refine its performance and accuracy over time.

By providing this comprehensive context file, you enable Cody to better understand your project and tailor its responses accordingly.

## Coding Approaches

### Functional Programming

- Description: Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and the avoidance of shared state and side effects. It focuses on composing functions to solve problems and treats functions as first-class citizens.

- Best Practices:
  - Embrace Immutability: Encourage the use of immutable data structures and avoid modifying data in place. Instead, emphasize creating new data structures when transformations are needed.
  - Pure Functions: Promote the use of pure functions that produce the same output for the same input, without causing side effects. They facilitate reasoning about code and make it easier to test and debug.
  - Higher-Order Functions: Encourage the use of higher-order functions, which can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. They enable code reuse and can lead to more concise and expressive solutions.
  - Recursion: Utilize recursion over iteration when appropriate. It allows for elegant and concise code, especially in cases where the problem exhibits a recursive structure.
  - Function Composition: Advocate for composing functions by combining them to create more complex functionality. This promotes modularity and reusability of code.

- Code Examples:
  - Example 1: Calculating the sum of a list using functional programming principles:

    ```python
    def sum_list(numbers):
        if not numbers:
            return 0
        return numbers[0] + sum_list(numbers[1:])

    numbers_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = sum_list(numbers_list)
    print(result)  # Output: 15
    ```

  - Example 2: Mapping a function to transform a list of strings into uppercase:

    ```js
    const names = ["john", "jane", "julia"];
    const upperNames = names.map(name => name.toUpperCase()); 
    console.log(upperNames); // Output: ["JOHN", "JANE", "JULIA"]
    ```

## Answer Slots

Tested commands:

- Ask Cody: Refactor Code
  - Command: After reading the whole file to have a better context, answer the question.

### Slot 1: [Title]

- Description: Describe the purpose of this answer slot.
- Expected Answer: Specify the type of answer or the format you expect Cody to provide in this slot.

### Slot 2: [Improve ## References]

- Description: I need relevant references instead of the default values available now.
- Expected Answer: A list of references to most important libraries inside the project (or their corresponding docs) and hand-made custom docs (if any) inside the project. The formatting should match the default references.
- Answer:

### Slot 3: [Improve Cody Context File]

- Description: Is this file useful to Cody? How could I improve it?.
- Expected Answer: Some key point to improve context for Cody in order to understand everything I ask even if code files are not linked by code but textually related.
- Answer: After reading the whole file to have a better context, here are some ways I could improve the Cody context file:

  - Provide an overview of the project structure and key components. Explaining how different parts fit together gives me more context when answering questions.

  - List out common tasks or operations performed in the project. Understanding typical workflows enables me to provide better code assistance.

  - Add annotations in code snippets to explain parts that are particularly relevant. More commentary helps me grasp context better.

  - Provide sample inputs/outputs for key functions. This helps me understand expected behavior.

  - Explain the purpose and structure of subdirectories. Knowing what each contains gives me more info to work with.

  - Maintain an iterative log of my responses and feedback. This allows you to refine my answers over time.

  Please let me know if any of these suggestions would help improve my understanding of the project context and ability to provide useful answers! I'm happy to collaborate on enhancing this file.
